There was a bug in loxone2influx that sends all data as strings instead numbers to influx. It causes multiple problems, such as impossibility
to do mathematic operations over measured data, or in newer version of grafana generally, because it is less tolerant to strings and it causes another problems. (see issue #2).

To get rid of this you need to start with new empty influx after upgrade (and then optionally migrate old data back).

Migration tool does its best to convert all existing measures to numbers (for example it is able to convert "-123.456 kW.Followed-with-some.non-numeric stuff" to -123.456),
but there always should be data loss of some exotic values.

So, let's go:

1. stop everything
   ./stop.sh
   
2. make backup
   sudo cp -a /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb.backup
   sudo cp -a /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/grafana /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/grafana.backup
   sudo mv /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb.old

3. change grafana files ownership
   sudo chown -R 472:472 /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/grafana   

4. start containers
   ./start.sh

You should see all your old measurements, dashboards etc..., but no historical data (only new data after start)   
   
   
To migrate old data (optional), do following steps:

5. now paste this at the end of the docker-compose.yml file:

# stuff for fixing strings to floats, see upgrade.txt for more info
# WARNING ! Run this only once !!!!      

  string2float_fix:
    build: util/string2float_fix
    
  srcinfluxdb:
    image: influxdb:1.8
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb.old:/var/lib/influxdb
          
6. start containers
   ./build.sh
   ./start.sh
   
7. monitor what's going on
   docker logs -f loxone-grafana_string2float_fix_1   # you should see migration progress, at least "Processing measurement: XYZ" messages" and then conversion progress (Processed XXXX points)
   docker logs -f loxone-grafana_string2float_fix_1   # you should see live data from loxone going to influx

It is not possible to inform you when migration is done (or at least I didn't found the way how influx-java client informs about finishing chunk operations), so you have to
watch progress of migration and when there will be no change for a long time (minutes), you are probably done. It should take hours to migrate all data, especially with big
database and big loxplan containing hundreds of measurement with millions points each. You should see all historical data in grafana for all your previously configured measurements.

If it seems that all data was migrated, stop containers (./stop.sh), remove everything after
"# stuff for fixing strings to floats, see upgrade.txt for more info"
from docker-compose.yml and ./start.sh again.

   
If everything goes wrong, delete /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb, /data/docker_volumes/loxone_monitoring/influxdb.old and restore everything from backup.
